# Exhibition Statement

## Title: "Unbounded Territories"
### Subtitle: "Where to Imagine an Alternative?"

*Unbound Territories* invites you to question the spaces we inhabit and envision radical alternatives. Drawing inspiration from Borges's "The Library of Babel," the exhibition transposes the author's infinite yet fragmented universe of knowledge into our lived reality. Just as Borges's labyrinthine library reflects the paradoxes of human conditions, Unbounded Territories posits that our contemporary spaces—private, public, and national—are arenas where multiple, intersecting struggles materialize. Unbound Territories exposes how our surroundings—from city layouts to office designs—shape society's valuation of human work, often dulling our senses and alienating us from our labor.  By highlighting the clash between human creativity's boundless potential and the constraints of capitalist spatial arrangements, Unbounded Territories encourages the participants to reimagine our relationship with space. We prompt you to consider how collective action might reconfigure our material conditions, dismantle oppressive structures, and foster new social organizations that awaken our senses and reclaim our full human potential.
