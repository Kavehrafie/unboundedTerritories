# Statement
In media res is an interactive triptych that explores the realization of the self within the
confines of the spaces we inhabit. Through the lenses of philosophy, psychology, and
ethics, this installation examines how our spatial environments influence our
perceptions of being, acting, and thinking. In three stages—to be perceived, to do, and
to think—participants experience the shifting dynamics of self-awareness and
authenticity as they move through the space.
By engaging with the human body as an interactive medium, the work challenges the
participants to confront the ways in which spaces—be they urban, domestic, or
metaphorical—mediate our understanding of ourselves. As participants navigate the
installation, they are prompted to reimagine their relationship with space, embodying
both the observer and the observed, and confronting the tension between personal
freedom and spatial limitations.
